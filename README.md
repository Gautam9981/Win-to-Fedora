# Win-to-Linux
This script helps you run Ubuntu or Fedora without a USB by creating a special partition on your computer. It frees up space, copies the needed files, and gives instructions to set up the boot menu. Just make sure you have the ISO file ready, turn off secure boot, and be prepared to manually adjust some settings during setup.
