# Win-to-Linux
This script helps you run Ubuntu or Fedora without a USB by creating a special partition on your computer. It frees up space, copies the needed files, and gives instructions to set up the boot menu. Just make you turn off secure boot. This will also host a bash script that will enable us to install some distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Mint, and Void; For now) from any live linux environment
